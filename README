Abstract
--------

KMediaPlayer is a simple media player aimed mainly at the KDE4 desktop. It
makes use of Phonon for media playback. The innovation sprang out of a
discussion on http://dot.kde.org [1].

The main aim of KMediaPlayer is to be small, easy to use, and to the point. It
does not aim to be another Kaffeine or Amarok. The main use case is for quick
playback from file managers, i.e. mostly Konqueror or Dolphin.
